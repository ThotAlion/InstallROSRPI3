# ROS on Raspberry Pi 3
This repository sets up a process to install ROS on a Raspberry Pi 3.
Raspberry Pi 3 is a very low cost computer with a very large community. It makes it the ideal support to build a low cost robot. But there are lots of hardware issues (wifi drivers, opencv compatibility) which makes the "first robot code line" very late. The purpose of this repository is to get a very stable installation process to get the necessary libraries for ROS.

ROS is a very efficient programming framework but on the other side it can be very complicated leading to have compilation errors for packages you will never use... For instance, RVIZ is a package too much CPU demanding.

For the moment, only Jade distribution is managed. The Kinetic Distribution will be available directly from apt-get in few months.
